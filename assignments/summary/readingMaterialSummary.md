### Problems and Challenges With Industry 4.0 Upgradation
- **Cost :** Industry 3.0 devices are very Expensive as a factory owner I dont want to switch to Industry 4.0 devices because they are Expensive.   
- **Downtime :** Changing Hardware means a big factory downtime, I dont want to shut down my factory to upgrade devices.
- **Reliability :** I dont want to invest in devices which are unproven and unreliable. 
- **Lack of Documentation**
- **Properitary PLC protocols**

> # SOLUTION
> Get data from Industry 3.0 devices/meters/sensors without changes to the original device.    
> And then send the data to the Cloud using Industry 4.0 devices
